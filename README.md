Structure of the website
The website is designed to be easy and user-friendly on all type of devices. It works fine on desktop. However I have had some difficulties in implementing the media queries for tablet and mobile devices, not to fear, I will fix the issues I have been having with the tablet screen size and mobile screen size by implementing the media queries correctly in a future update. Too make sure that the user has a fantastic user experience on all devices. All parts are designed to achieve maximum user satisfaction. User will get to interact with the links and buttons that have a hover effect applied on them.

 Git
I wanted to use git as a version control system to keep track of all the changes while building the project but ran into some difficulties as my computer would not let me push the changes I was making in a periodic manner to GitHub, so I was unable to use git to keep track of my project. However I plan to use git in the future after fixing the issues I have been having with pushing my changes.
Testing
I used chrome developer tools throughout the development stages of the project to help me test for issues I have been having with my website, it is where I discovered issues with tablet and mobile screen sizes.
Issues found during site development
As mentioned earlier I have been having issues with tablet and mobile devices that the media queries need implementing correctly. The website does not show well on tablet and mobile devices at the moment due to screen sizes issues. I will fix this in future updates.
Code Validation
At the end of the project I used the following website to validate my code
•	W3C CSS Validator to validate CSS and HTML
Deployment 
The project is deployed on GitHub pages via logging in into the GitHub website and following the deployment steps on GitHub.
