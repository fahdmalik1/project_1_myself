        <img src="images/about-pic.jpeg" alt="a man using two laptops to write code">
        <p>I am studying full-stack software development to become a Full-stack software Developer. The curriculum includes: Html, CSS, JavaScript, Python, SQL and Django.</p>
        <p>From the moment I wrote “Hello World!” in the my first Python application, I was hooked into the world of software development, But software development has never been “just a job for me!” It has offered me an engaging challenge to continually learn and improve my skills in creating high quality software. What started as a simple “Hello World!” has become a full fledged passion that only gets more exciting as time goes by.</p>
        <p>I am also a father of an absolutely amazing 2 year old, who has started nursery lately and who has started talking recently. He is my little bundle of joy, who keeps me on my toes. I love taking him to the park and spending good quality family time together.</p>
